#Make sure your autosave is ON
#Press the key combination: Ctrl+Shift+P
#Type Snippets
#Scroll down a bit and select New Global Snippets File
#Then some sort of a box will appear, and type(name it) "python-trigger" in there
#A file will appear, delete everything in that file
#Paste this code-block:
{
    "Switch to Python": {
        "prefix": "pyset",
        "body": [
            "# -*- coding: python -*-",
            "$0"
        ],
        "description": "Trigger Python Language Mode"
    }
}
#Save it (Press Ctrl+S) [Though not required if your autosave is ON, but still do it for mental clarity]


#Now if you type something like p or py in a new file, VSCode will itself start suggesting Python over the text. Press tab.
#This would prove that your snippets are working
